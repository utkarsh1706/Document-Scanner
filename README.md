# Document-Scanner
This is a document scanner created using OpenCV. In this I have used image contouring, image thresholding, edge detection and image stacking.

It works even when the image is clicked at an angle as warp perspective is used to tackle this condition.

By a click of a single button, you can save your scanned image.

[Document Scanner.py](https://github.com/utkarsh1706/Document-Scanner/blob/main/Document%20Scanner.py) contains the main code and [utils.py](https://github.com/utkarsh1706/Document-Scanner/blob/main/utlis.py) contains all the functions to be used in the main code.
